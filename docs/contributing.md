# Contributing to Hishel

Thank you for being interested in contributing to `Hishel`! We appreciate your efforts and welcome contributions of all kinds.

You can contribute by:

- Reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/karpetrosyan/hishel/pulls)
- [Opening an issue](https://github.com/karpetrosyan/hishel/issues/new) to report bugs or suggest features
- [Adding a new feature](https://github.com/karpetrosyan/hishel/compare)
- ‚≠ê **Starring the repository** on [GitHub](https://github.com/karpetrosyan/hishel) - it helps the project grow!

This guide will help you understand the development process and repository structure.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**: Fork [Hishel](https://github.com/karpetrosyan/hishel/) to your GitHub account

2. **Clone and create a branch**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/hishel
cd hishel
git switch -c my-feature-name
```

3. **Install dependencies**: This project uses `uv` for dependency management. Make sure you have it installed, then install the project dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

## Repository Structure

### The `scripts/` Folder

The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts to simplify development and maintenance tasks:

- **`scripts/fix`** - Automatically fixes code style issues, formats code, and generates synchronous code from async code
- **`scripts/lint`** - Validates code quality (linting, formatting, type checking, async/sync consistency)
- **`scripts/test`** - Runs the test suite with coverage reporting
- **`scripts/unasync`** - Converts async code to sync code (see below for details)

### Usage Example

```bash
# Fix code style and generate sync files
./scripts/fix

# Check code quality
./scripts/lint

# Run tests with coverage
./scripts/test
```

## Critical: Async/Sync Code Generation

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Do not manually edit auto-generated synchronous files!**

Hishel maintains both async and sync APIs without code duplication using an **unasync** strategy similar to [httpcore](https://github.com/encode/httpcore).

### How It Works

**Write async code once** - All shared async/sync functionality is written in async files:

- `hishel/_core/_storages/_async_*.py` ‚Üí auto-generates ‚Üí `hishel/_core/_storages/_sync_*.py`
- `tests/_core/_async/*.py` ‚Üí auto-generates ‚Üí `tests/_core/_sync/*.py`

**Automatic transformation** - The `scripts/unasync` script converts async code to sync:

```python
# Async code (you write this)
async def store(self, key: str) -> None:
    async with self.connection as conn:
        await conn.execute(...)

# Sync code (automatically generated)
def store(self, key: str) -> None:
    with self.connection as conn:
        conn.execute(...)
```

### Using the Script

```bash
# Generate sync files from async files
./scripts/unasync

# Check if sync files are up-to-date (CI)
./scripts/unasync --check

# Or use helper scripts
./scripts/fix     # Auto-generates sync files + formatting
./scripts/lint    # Checks sync files are up-to-date
```

### Development Rules

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Write and edit async files only (`_async_*.py`)
- Run `./scripts/fix` before committing
- Let the script generate all sync files

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Manually edit sync files (`_sync_*.py`)
- Commit async changes without running unasync
- Modify the sync test files directly

## Development Workflow

### Before Submitting a PR

1. **Make your changes** in the async versions of files
2. **Run the fix script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/fix
   ```
3. **Run the linter**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/lint
   ```
4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test
   ```
